# Introduction

This tutorial hopes to help you set up and begin interacting with your neo4j aura instance with you next.js project! The neo4j site is a wonderful resource with a helpful guide on how to set up a neo4j driver and how to begin some simply queries. However, this tutorial seeks to give a deeper and more detailed guide into integrating this driver more seamlessly into your next project!

**Note:** There are several options when using a neo4j graphical database. The basic options are to have a full database, to be self or fully-managed, or to use an Aura DB instance. The second is less secure, but runs off their servers instead of you needing to run it on your own machine. This tutorial is specifically for the Aura DB instance option. Please visit and explore the [neo4j site](https://neo4j.com/) to ensure this is the best option for you before continuing in the tutorial.
