## World Anvil

Primary Site: [link](https://www.worldanvil.com/)

World Anvil desribes itself as a toolset for dungeon masters, authors, and writers. They offer resources and tools for world-building and rpg campaign managment. There are many tools offered which can be used in flexible ways. There is a free version, but many more specific tools are only available through subscription.

### Relation

World Anvil is a current world-building website. This would likely be considered a competitor to my program.

### Features

**Articles / Dashboard:** In this website you can make "articles" and label each article as describing a building, character, country, deity, geography, item, organization, religion, settlement, species, vehicle, or unlabel article. This would be the same as my "entires". I had a very similar idea of labeling the entries in this way, but I would like to have the category be one which is picked after creating the entry, and maybe allowing the user to make additional categories so the categories I create can be simpler and fewer. There is a page where each article is listed together to be accessed or viewed. I think this is an integral feature to have. Although, World Anvil seems to have two different ones which feels unnecessary for my uses. When a specific article is selected, the links to other articles  goes away, requiring users to leave and search for another. This is where I would like mine to differ, with a selected entry taking up the whole screen (the way a wiki article would) and have names and important dates highlighted or linked to the related entry.

**Community Page / Public View:** World Anvil's starting page is a community page. There are posts by users, news, ads, etc. Additionally, users automatically have their world public, open to share with all those who use the website. A subscription is required to make the world private. I see the appeal: bouncing ideas off other creators or looking to other's work for inspiration and I think this is a cool idea for what they are doing, but I do not want to take my website in that direction. To me, the community page seems cluttered, and I would prefer when my users choose to share their worlds, for that to be a private matter.

**Interactive Maps:** Users can upload images to world anvil and "pin" particular locations with notes and titles. Most uses of the interactive maps are locked for free users. I like the idea of interactive maps, but think the pinning notes system is not the exact direction I want to go in. If possible, I'd love to add a feature which allows entries to be linked to certain areas of a given image/map. That way the user can select an area covering a city/country/continent and clicking that area would bring the user to the linked entry.

**Calendars / Timelines:** World Anvil allows creators to create custom calendars or timelines which hold articles based on dates. I like this idea, and was not something I originally though of. If I do add these features (or similar ones) I think I would prefer to have them as sections or parts inside entries, instead of seperate from them, or holding several entries.

**Game Master or Author Choice:** When beginning a world with World Anvil, it asks you to select what kind of user you are, whether you are a game master, author, etc. The resources you get, organization of them, and communities you connect with change based off this choice. I want my website to be more general, and not limit users to one category.


## Campfire

Primary Site: [link](https://www.campfirewriting.com/)

Campfire advertises itself as a web-based reading and writing platform for genre fiction. It offers tools to organize information for a story, publish chapters, and read other's works in the genre. While it offers a free trial, Campfire is a subscription-required service.

### Relation

Campfire could be considered a competitor for my project, but will offer signifigantly different features on top of those they would share.

### Features

**Story Publishing / Public View:** Campfire's focus is on writing, assisting authors with stories, arcs, characters. This is a place where written works can be "published" for others to read, as well as allowing user to read other published stories as well. This public aspect is not a direction I want to go in, but perhaps allowing for a space for full chapters to be written, or entries without links to others, could be a useful addition.

**Learning:** Campfire offers blogs, articles, and advise to users on many subjects such as character design, story telling, map making, etc. This is not something I am currently interested in, but I find it interesting and helpful for their uses

**Entries:** Campfire has a version of what would be my "entries" which are sections into categories. There is a tab for characters, religions, timelines, species, maps, and more. Much like World Anvil's articles, I don't like how seperated these entires would be, and would prefer all entires to be listed together, to be sorted or searched through by the user. Also, the choices feel overwhelming to me as they are all listed on the side of the screen, instead I'd rather it be an option inside the entry.

**Relationships:** There is a feature to put characters into relaitonships and family trees to visualize their relationships to one another. This is a great idea I think especially with my idea of linking entires together. I'd love to add a feature like this in the future.

**Calendars / Timelines**

## Kanka

Primary Site: [link](https://app.kanka.io/)

Kanka is an rpg campaign manager and world-building tool. Many of the offered features are very similar to the ones mentioned previously, but with no subscription required.

### Relation

Kanka would be a competitor to my project. This is the closest to my idea that I have found in world-building websites. 

### Features

**Connections:** Each entry in Kanka, whether it is a character, location, religion, races, etc. has a tab with all labeled connections. This idea is very similar to my linking system I want to have in place. The difference would be linking names directly, rather than having connections in a tab.

**Mentions:** When writing descriptions in Kanka, if you want to mention the name of another entry, you can do so by typing @ and selecting the entry. This creates a connection and will automatically change the name as written if you change the name of that entry. I love this idea and think it is so helpful. I think I will combine the ideas of this mentioning system and the connections system into one feature. If I can get it to the point of changing names automatically the way Kanka does that would be amazing.

**Entries:** Kanka handles entries very similarly to World Anvil and Campfire.

**Collaboration:** Kanka does have a public view, but offers a free private version. Both public and private allow for collaboration. The world can be shared with others, who can be editors or viewers, and have access to see some entries and not others. This is a great feature and is very similar to the one I would like to add. The only changes I would like to add is allowing for sections of entries to be visible/hidden as well as whole entires. Additiionally, a system for non-editors (like your players) to comment on entries would be really cool I think.

**Disabling Modules:** Kanka also offers a somewhat overwhelming amount of options and categories on the side of the screen. However, unlike the others, it offers a disabling of modules that the user does not want or need. I like this idea, but think I would prefer to do the opposite. Rather than starting with a lot and offering the ability to widdle down, I'd prefer to give a few (what I think are) essential categories and allow for more to be added, including custom ones.

**Customizable Dashboard:** A dashboard is rather standard to all these sites, but Kanka offers the ability to alter and customize who your dashbpard looks and what informatin is present there. I like this idea, but it feels like a much later feature I *may* add. I feel as long as a dashboard is simple, the organization and customization shouldn't be too much an issue.

## LegendKeeper

Primary Site: [link](https://app.legendkeeper.com/)

LegendKeeper advertises itself as a world-building tool and campaign manager. Although there is a free trial, a purchase or subscription is required.

### Relation

LegendKeeper would be a competitor to my project.

### Features

**Wiki Page:** LegendKeeper calls its entries wiki pages and does not organize these into categories. Tags can be given to each page which can be used to organize them. Each wiki page can have more than one "entry" to it. There is a title, and options to write multiple descriptions, add a map, and more. So far, this is my favorite way of organizing and creating entires, however I do like putting categories onto them. Tags or folder is a good idea to offer as organization as well.

**Mentions:** LegendKeeper has a mention system similar to Kanka, but the link is direct. Clicking on the name will bring you to the entry, just as I would like to do with my project. Additionally, if a link is not made, but the name of another entry is given, it will suggest the link to be made. This is a great touch and something I would love to add if time allows it.

**Simplicity:** What I appreciate most about LegendKeeper is its lack of clutter, which I aim for as well when making my project

**Shortcuts:** A wikipage can be given a short cut above all the others. I think this count be useful for things such as continent or important countries. However, I think a pinning or folder approach would be the way I would prefer to do it. I can see the short-cut bar becoming cluttered quickly.

**Hidden entries/sections:** Since a wikipage can have mutliple entires within, a full page or individual enty can be made hidden to those the world is shared to. This is the closest to my desired hiding system. Although, I would like all the information to be where the user wants it to be, so it does not need to be seperated based on hidden or not hidden.
