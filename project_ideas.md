# My Project Ideas

## My World Wiki
A website to organize and share information on custom worlds, places, events, etc.

This project would be a website meant to hold information in a wiki-style organization pattern. The user can create an entry which describes a person, place, event, or other. 
Inside this entry could have words and phrases which link to other entries, related photos, or timelines. The "world" can then be shared with others, this way a DM could share
the information to their world setting with their players, or an author could share their ideas for a story with a friend or editor. Each entry will have the option to be visible
or hiddden from those the world is shared to, and inside each entry there can be sections which can be hidden or visible. That way no one needs to know that plot twist you're
working on, or the secrets you wish not to share.

I have always loved world-building, as a DM in DnD games or as a fantasy author. There are many great tools out there for building maps, or creating notes, or organizing all
needed info onto one page. However, I feel these systems are disjointed. Names are difficult to connect, relating information too easily seperated and small details forgotten 
or lost. I know I would use and love this website if it existed.
