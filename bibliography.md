### World Anvil

Primary Site: [link](https://www.worldanvil.com/)

#### Relation

World Anvil is a current world-building website. This would likely be considered a competitor to my program.

#### Features

**Articles:** In this website you can make "articles" and label each article as describing a building, character, country, deity, geography, item, organization, religion, settlement, species, vehicle, or unlabel article. This would be the same as my "entires". I had a very similar idea of labeling the entries in this way, but I would like to have the category be one which is picked after creating the entry, and maybe allowing the user to make additional categories so the categories I create can be simpler and fewer.

**Community Page:** World Anvil's starting page is a community page. There are posts by users, news, ads, etc. I think this is a cool idea for what they are doing,
but I do not want to take my website in that direction. To me, this seems cluttered, and for smaller scale world-builders this feel unnecessary to me.

**Public View:** On World Anvil, I have the option to make my world public, to share with all those who use the website. In a similar vein to the previous feature, this is not something I am interested in. I see the appeal: bouncing ideas off other creators or looking to other's work for inspiration. However, this is not a feature I would consider that important. When my users share their worlds, I want that to be a private matter.

**Dashboard:** There is a page where each article is listed together to be accessed or viewed. I think this is an integral feature to have. Although, World Anvil seems to have two different ones which feels unnecessary for my uses.

**Interactive Maps:** Users can upload images to world anvil
